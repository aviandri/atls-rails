Salah satunya adalah fiksasi eksterna yang merupakan teknologi baru yang digunakan untuk menstabilkan patah tulang atau fraktur dengan menggunakan pin yang dihubungkan dengan bars atau frame yang dapat dilihat diluar tubuh.<br>Teknik ini pertama kali dilakukan oleh Strader seorang dokter hewan kemudian digunakan untuk manusia lebih dari 5 dekade yang lalu oleh Roger<br><strong>DEFINISI</strong><br>Fiksasi eksterna adalah alat yang diletakkan diluar kulit untuk menstabilisasikan fragmen tulang dengan memasukkan dua atau tiga pin metal perkutaneus menembus tulang pada bagian proksimal dan distal dari tempat fraktur dan pin tersebut dihubungkan satu sama lain dengan menggunakan eksternal bars. Teknik ini terutama atau kebanyakan digunakan untuk fraktur pada tulang tibia, tetapi juga dapat dilakukan pada tulang femur, humerus dan pelvis.<br>Prinsip dasar dari teknik ini adalah dengan menggunakan pin yang diletakkan pada bagian proksimal dan distal terhadap daerah atau zona trauma, kemudian pin-pin tersebut dihubungkan satu sama lain dengan rangka luar atau eksternal frame atau rigid bars yang berfungsi untuk menstabilisasikan fraktur. Alat ini dapat digunakan sebagai temporary treatment untuk trauma muskuloskeletal atau sebagai definitive treatment berdasarkan lokasi dan tipe trauma yang terjadi pada tulang dan jaringan lunak.<br>Pada pelvis, kompresi oleh fiksasi eksterna dapat menstabilisasikan pelvis, mengurangi perdarahan, sebagai penatalaksanaan resusitasi awal dan sebagai definitive treatment pada beberapa trauma .<br>Fiksasi eksterna terutama digunakan ketika terdapat luka dan trauma pada jaringan lunak yang merupakan kontraindikasi langsung untuk dilakukan pembedahan terhadap fraktur.<br><strong>TIPE FIKSASI EKSTERNA</strong><br>Terdapat beberapa tipe fiksasi eksterna yaitu :<br>Pin fixators : unilateral, bilateral frame, V-shaped dan triangular.<br>Ring (Wire fixator)<br>Hybrid fixators (wire and pin), adalah tipe fiksasi eksternal yang digunakan untuk fraktur tertutup pada sendi. Dinamakan hybrid karena terdiri dari wire fixation (3/4 ring fixator) dengan pin fixator (fiksasi unilateral pada bagian diafisis).<br>Pinless external fixators , tujuan utama desain dari pinless fixator adalah untuk menghindari tembusnya pin kedalam kanalis medularis.<br>Mefisto, merupakan teknik fiksasi eksterna yang baru diperkenalkan dan dirancang untuk limb lengthening dan bone transport.<br><strong>INDIKASI</strong><br>Terdapat indikasi absolut untuk penatalaksanan fiksasi baik internal maupun eksternal pada fraktur yang terbagi menjadi dua bagian utama yaitu :<br>1. Saving life, yang dimaksud dengan saving life atau menyelamatkan hidup adalah dengan adanya stabilisasi yang cepat maka dapat mengurangi resiko terjadinya kematian.<br>2. Saving Limb, stabilisasi pada fraktur diafisis merupakan suatu bagian penatalaksanan darurat terutama pada fraktur dengan trauma jaringan lunak dimana dengan stabilisasi dapat mengurangi kerusakan yang lebih lanjut pada jaringan lunak.<br>Sedangkan indikasi pada fiksasi eksterna yaitu :<br><strong><em>Fraktur Terbuka</em></strong><br>Fiksasi eksterna merupakan satu-satunya kemungkinan yang digunakan untuk menstabilkan tulang pada fraktur terbuka, khususnya pada fraktur terbuka tipe III B dan C. Dengan fiksasi eksterna maka dapat menghindari bertambahnya kerusakan pada jaringan lunak, dan vaskularisasi tulang dapat berjalan dengan baik.<br><strong><em>Fraktur Tertutup</em></strong><br>Pada fraktur tertutup, fiksasi eksterna jarang dilakukan, kecuali pada polytrauma yang berat, atau terdapat luka memar yang berat pada fraktur tertutup.<br><strong><em>Polytrauma</em></strong><br>Pada polytrauma yang berat, fiksasi eksterna dapat menjadi indikasi utama untuk menstabilisasi multiple fractures.<br><strong><em>Fraktur pada Anak-anak</em></strong><br>Pada anak-anak, meskipun terdapat polytrauma atau tidak, fiksasi eksterna tetap merupakan indikasi terapi khususnya pada ekstremitas bawah atau pada kasus dengan fraktur terbuka.<br><strong><em>Indikasi Khusus- articular fractures/ joint bridging</em></strong><br>Rekonstruksi sendi yang tepat dan fiksasi yang stabil dengan kompresi interfragmen yang dapat mengurangi nyeri pada pergerakan bebas merupakan terapi utama untuk articular fractures. Tujuan ini dapat dilaksanakan dengan cara ORIF atau pada simpler fractures dengan cara kombinasi lag-screw fixation dan hybrid fixator.<br><strong>KEUNTUNGAN DAN KERUGIAN</strong><br><em>A.

Dalam penanganan pada seorang pasien yang mengalami fraktur terdapat beberapa cara yang digunakan tergantung dari bagaimana bentuk fraktur yang terjadi. Salah satunya adalah fiksasi eksterna yang merupakan teknologi baru yang digunakan untuk menstabilkan patah tulang atau fraktur dengan menggunakan pin yang dihubungkan dengan bars atau frame yang dapat dilihat diluar tubuh.
Teknik ini pertama kali dilakukan oleh Strader seorang dokter hewan kemudian digunakan untuk manusia lebih dari 5 dekade yang lalu oleh Roger
DEFINISI
Fiksasi eksterna adalah alat yang diletakkan diluar kulit untuk menstabilisasikan fragmen tulang dengan memasukkan dua atau tiga pin metal perkutaneus menembus tulang pada bagian proksimal dan distal dari tempat fraktur dan pin tersebut dihubungkan satu sama lain dengan menggunakan eksternal bars. Teknik ini terutama atau kebanyakan digunakan untuk fraktur pada tulang tibia, tetapi juga dapat dilakukan pada tulang femur, humerus dan pelvis.
Prinsip dasar dari teknik ini adalah dengan menggunakan pin yang diletakkan pada bagian proksimal dan distal terhadap daerah atau zona trauma, kemudian pin-pin tersebut dihubungkan satu sama lain dengan rangka luar atau eksternal frame atau rigid bars yang berfungsi untuk menstabilisasikan fraktur. Alat ini dapat digunakan sebagai temporary treatment untuk trauma muskuloskeletal atau sebagai definitive treatment berdasarkan lokasi dan tipe trauma yang terjadi pada tulang dan jaringan lunak.
Pada pelvis, kompresi oleh fiksasi eksterna dapat menstabilisasikan pelvis, mengurangi perdarahan, sebagai penatalaksanaan resusitasi awal dan sebagai definitive treatment pada beberapa trauma .
Fiksasi eksterna terutama digunakan ketika terdapat luka dan trauma pada jaringan lunak yang merupakan kontraindikasi langsung untuk dilakukan pembedahan terhadap fraktur.
TIPE FIKSASI EKSTERNA
Terdapat beberapa tipe fiksasi eksterna yaitu :
Pin fixators : unilateral, bilateral frame, V-shaped dan triangular.
Ring (Wire fixator)
Hybrid fixators (wire and pin), adalah tipe fiksasi eksternal yang digunakan untuk fraktur tertutup pada sendi. Dinamakan hybrid karena terdiri dari wire fixation (3/4 ring fixator) dengan pin fixator (fiksasi unilateral pada bagian diafisis).
Pinless external fixators , tujuan utama desain dari pinless fixator adalah untuk menghindari tembusnya pin kedalam kanalis medularis.
Mefisto, merupakan teknik fiksasi eksterna yang baru diperkenalkan dan dirancang untuk limb lengthening dan bone transport.
INDIKASI
Terdapat indikasi absolut untuk penatalaksanan fiksasi baik internal maupun eksternal pada fraktur yang terbagi menjadi dua bagian utama yaitu :
1. Saving life, yang dimaksud dengan saving life atau menyelamatkan hidup adalah dengan adanya stabilisasi yang cepat maka dapat mengurangi resiko terjadinya kematian.
2. Saving Limb, stabilisasi pada fraktur diafisis merupakan suatu bagian penatalaksanan darurat terutama pada fraktur dengan trauma jaringan lunak dimana dengan stabilisasi dapat mengurangi kerusakan yang lebih lanjut pada jaringan lunak.
Sedangkan indikasi pada fiksasi eksterna yaitu :
Fraktur Terbuka
Fiksasi eksterna merupakan satu-satunya kemungkinan yang digunakan untuk menstabilkan tulang pada fraktur terbuka, khususnya pada fraktur terbuka tipe III B dan C. Dengan fiksasi eksterna maka dapat menghindari bertambahnya kerusakan pada jaringan lunak, dan vaskularisasi tulang dapat berjalan dengan baik.
Fraktur Tertutup
Pada fraktur tertutup, fiksasi eksterna jarang dilakukan, kecuali pada polytrauma yang berat, atau terdapat luka memar yang berat pada fraktur tertutup.
Polytrauma
Pada polytrauma yang berat, fiksasi eksterna dapat menjadi indikasi utama untuk menstabilisasi multiple fractures.
Fraktur pada Anak-anak
Pada anak-anak, meskipun terdapat polytrauma atau tidak, fiksasi eksterna tetap merupakan indikasi terapi khususnya pada ekstremitas bawah atau pada kasus dengan fraktur terbuka.
Indikasi Khusus- articular fractures/ joint bridging
Rekonstruksi sendi yang tepat dan fiksasi yang stabil dengan kompresi interfragmen yang dapat mengurangi nyeri pada pergerakan bebas merupakan terapi utama untuk articular fractures. Tujuan ini dapat dilaksanakan dengan cara ORIF atau pada simpler fractures dengan cara kombinasi lag-screw fixation dan hybrid fixator.

 6. Rangka fiksasi dapat terdiri dari beberapa rangkaian sehingga pasien merasa tidak nyaman dan dengan alasan estetika.
METODE DAN TEKNIK PEMASANGAN
METODE
Terdapat dua metode yang pada umumnya digunakan untuk meletakkan pin yang digunakan pada fiksasi eksterna yaitu :

Through-and-through, yaitu masing-masing pin dimasukkan melalui kulit dan menembus fragmen tulang kemudian keluar menembus kulit pada sisi sebelahnya.
One-side (Cantilever system), yaitu pin dimasukkan melewati fragmen tulang tetapi tidak sampai menembus sampai pada sisi sebelah dan menonjol hanya pada salah satu sisi tubuh.
 TEKNIK PEMASANGAN

Teknik pin insertion
Sebelum dilakukan fiksasi, berikan tanda silang pada tempat atau daerah “safe Zone” sebagai tempat untuk memasukkan pin dan meminimalkan resiko trauma pada sistem saraf, pembuluh darah dan tendo.
1. Diafisis
• Untuk pemasangan pin pada bagian diafisis sangat penting bagi kita untuk menghindari terjadinya kerusakan pada tulang akibat rasa panas yang ditimbulkan pada saat memasukkan pin atau schanz screws.
• Untuk memasukkan pin atau schanz screws secara tepat, maka pin tersebut harus mencapai korteks pada bagian ujungnya tetapi tidak sampai menembus terlalu jauh. Dan untuk mencapai sasaran yang tepat maka kita bisa menggunakan ukuran atau dibantu dengan intraoperative x-ray.
• Jika pin yang dimasukkan tidak mencapai ujung korteks maka kemungkinan pin yang digunakan agak pendek atau pin yang dimasukkan menembus bagian lain. Dan dari gambaran x-ray kontrol akan tampak ‘empty hole’ pada bagian ujung korteks yang berarti skrup yang dimasukkan tidak mencapai ujung korteks.
2. Metafisis
Untuk pemasangan pada bagian metafisis terdapat hal-hal penting yang harus diperhatikan pada saat akan memasukkan pin atau schanz screw yaitu :
• Tidak membuat trauma pada pembuluh darah dan nadi.
• Tidak meletakkan pin pada sendi.
• Menghindari fracture lines.
• Menggunakan self-drilling screws pada tulang metafisis.

Frame Construction
a. Tampak gambaran ilustrasi penatalaksanaan ‘fixator first’ untuk complex open fracture.
b. Pada setiap fragment tulang, pin dipasang berdasarkan kondisi jaringan lunak.
c. Hubungkan pin pada rangka atau bar yang memiliki dua pengait untuk mereposisi.
d. Setelah direposisi, kedua bars dihubungkan dengan tube ketiga dan dilakukan tube-to-tube clamps.
e. Tampak pada tulang fibula juga difiksasi untuk menjaga stabilisasi.
PERAWATAN POST OPERATIVE
Perawatan Pin-track.
Pin site dibersihkan tiap hari dengan menggunakan cairan hydrogen peroxide atau sabun antibakteri atau dengan larutan betadine. Pasien dilatih tiap 2-4 minggu sampai penyembuhan fraktur. Pin site dijaga agar tidak terjadi infeksi dan semua hubungan fiksator di cek untuk memastikan tetap saling berhubungan. Pada 4-6 minggu pertama hanya diberikan latihan keseimbangan berat badan. Pada pasien dengan trauma pada tumit yang tidak stabil, maka pin pada kaki dapat di pertahankan lebih lama sampai tumit dapat stabil kembali.
Timing of procedure
Intramedullary nailing atau pemasangan plat atau fiksasi interna dipertimbangkan aman jika dilaksanakan dalam dua minggu pertama setelah fiksasi eksterna, dimana perawatan pin-site baik tanpa tanda-tanda infeksi. Kemudian fiksasi eksterna dapat dilepaskan setelah 6-8 minggu dengan mempertimbangkan fracture healing.
KOMPLIKASI
Terdapat beberapa potensi komplikasi dengan sepsis yang pada umumnya terjadi yaitu :
Pin Tract Infection. Tanpa adanya keahlian dalam teknik pemasangan pin dan perawatan yang baik, maka hal ini merupakan komplikasi yang pada umumnya paling banyak terjadi sekitar 30 %. Dimulai dari proses radang yang berasal dari luka sampai terjadi infeksi superfisial yang dapat menyebabkan terjadinya osteomyelitis hingga memerlukan pemberian antibiotik.
Gangguan Neurovaskular . Seorang ahli bedah harus mengetahui daerah “safe zone” dan “danger zone” sebelum memasang pin. Nervus radialis pada bagian distal tangan dan pada bagian proksimal dari telapak tangan, dan arteri tibialis anterior serta nervus peroneus pada kaki merupakan tempat yang paling sering terkena. Vessel penetration , trombosis, arterivenous fistula, dan aneurysma sering ditemukan.
Refraktur. Kemungkinan besar dapat terjadi pada saat mengeluarkan pin. Seperti pada metode open reduction dapat menjadi sulit atau tidak mungkin dilakukan apabila terdapat infeksi pada pin tract.

Pada pelvis, kompresi oleh fiksasi eksterna dapat menstabilisasikan pelvis, mengurangi perdarahan, sebagai penatalaksanaan resusitasi awal dan sebagai definitive treatment pada beberapa trauma .
Fiksasi eksterna terutama digunakan ketika terdapat luka dan trauma pada jaringan lunak yang merupakan kontraindikasi langsung untuk dilakukan pembedahan terhadap fraktur.
TIPE FIKSASI EKSTERNA
Terdapat beberapa tipe fiksasi eksterna yaitu :
Pin fixators : unilateral, bilateral frame, V-shaped dan triangular.<br>&nbsp;Ring (Wire fixator)
Hybrid fixators (wire and pin), adalah tipe fiksasi eksternal yang digunakan untuk fraktur tertutup pada sendi. Dinamakan hybrid karena terdiri dari wire fixation (3/4 ring fixator) dengan pin fixator (fiksasi unilateral pada bagian diafisis).
Pinless external fixators , tujuan utama desain dari pinless fixator adalah untuk menghindari tembusnya pin kedalam kanalis medularis.
Mefisto, merupakan teknik fiksasi eksterna yang baru diperkenalkan dan dirancang untuk limb lengthening dan bone transport.
INDIKASI
Terdapat indikasi absolut untuk penatalaksanan fiksasi baik internal maupun eksternal pada fraktur yang terbagi menjadi dua bagian utama yaitu :
<br>1. Saving life, yang dimaksud dengan saving life atau menyelamatkan hidup adalah dengan adanya stabilisasi yang cepat maka dapat mengurangi resiko terjadinya kematian.
2. Saving Limb, stabilisasi pada fraktur diafisis merupakan suatu bagian penatalaksanan darurat terutama pada fraktur dengan trauma jaringan lunak dimana dengan stabilisasi dapat mengurangi kerusakan yang lebih lanjut pada jaringan lunak.
Sedangkan indikasi pada fiksasi eksterna yaitu :
Fraktur Terbuka
Fiksasi eksterna merupakan satu-satunya kemungkinan yang digunakan untuk menstabilkan tulang pada fraktur terbuka, khususnya pada fraktur terbuka tipe III B dan C. Dengan fiksasi eksterna maka dapat menghindari bertambahnya kerusakan pada jaringan lunak, dan vaskularisasi tulang dapat berjalan dengan baik.
Fraktur Tertutup
Pada fraktur tertutup, fiksasi eksterna jarang dilakukan, kecuali pada polytrauma yang berat, atau terdapat luka memar yang berat pada fraktur tertutup.
Polytrauma
Pada polytrauma yang berat, fiksasi eksterna dapat menjadi indikasi utama untuk menstabilisasi multiple fractures.
Fraktur pada Anak-anak
Pada anak-anak, meskipun terdapat polytrauma atau tidak, fiksasi eksterna tetap merupakan indikasi terapi khususnya pada ekstremitas bawah atau pada kasus dengan fraktur terbuka.
Indikasi Khusus- articular fractures/ joint bridging
Rekonstruksi sendi yang tepat dan fiksasi yang stabil dengan kompresi interfragmen yang dapat mengurangi nyeri pada pergerakan bebas merupakan terapi utama untuk articular fractures. Tujuan ini dapat dilaksanakan dengan cara ORIF atau pada simpler fractures dengan cara kombinasi lag-screw fixation dan hybrid fixator.

METODE DAN TEKNIK PEMASANGAN
METODE
Terdapat dua metode yang pada umumnya digunakan untuk meletakkan pin yang digunakan pada fiksasi eksterna yaitu :

Through-and-through, yaitu masing-masing pin dimasukkan melalui kulit dan menembus fragmen tulang kemudian keluar menembus kulit pada sisi sebelahnya.
One-side (Cantilever system), yaitu pin dimasukkan melewati fragmen tulang tetapi tidak sampai menembus sampai pada sisi sebelah dan menonjol hanya pada salah satu sisi tubuh.
 TEKNIK PEMASANGAN

Teknik pin insertion
Sebelum dilakukan fiksasi, berikan tanda silang pada tempat atau daerah “safe Zone” sebagai tempat untuk memasukkan pin dan meminimalkan resiko trauma pada sistem saraf, pembuluh darah dan tendo.
1. Diafisis
• Untuk pemasangan pin pada bagian diafisis sangat penting bagi kita untuk menghindari terjadinya kerusakan pada tulang akibat rasa panas yang ditimbulkan pada saat memasukkan pin atau schanz screws.
• Untuk memasukkan pin atau schanz screws secara tepat, maka pin tersebut harus mencapai korteks pada bagian ujungnya tetapi tidak sampai menembus terlalu jauh. Dan untuk mencapai sasaran yang tepat maka kita bisa menggunakan ukuran atau dibantu dengan intraoperative x-ray.
• Jika pin yang dimasukkan tidak mencapai ujung korteks maka kemungkinan pin yang digunakan agak pendek atau pin yang dimasukkan menembus bagian lain. Dan dari gambaran x-ray kontrol akan tampak ‘empty hole’ pada bagian ujung korteks yang berarti skrup yang dimasukkan tidak mencapai ujung korteks.
2. Metafisis
Untuk pemasangan pada bagian metafisis terdapat hal-hal penting yang harus diperhatikan pada saat akan memasukkan pin atau schanz screw yaitu :
• Tidak membuat trauma pada pembuluh darah dan nadi.
• Tidak meletakkan pin pada sendi.
• Menghindari fracture lines.
• Menggunakan self-drilling screws pada tulang metafisis.

Frame Construction
a. Tampak gambaran ilustrasi penatalaksanaan ‘fixator first’ untuk complex open fracture.
b. Pada setiap fragment tulang, pin dipasang berdasarkan kondisi jaringan lunak.
c. Hubungkan pin pada rangka atau bar yang memiliki dua pengait untuk mereposisi.
d. Setelah direposisi, kedua bars dihubungkan dengan tube ketiga dan dilakukan tube-to-tube clamps.
e. Tampak pada tulang fibula juga difiksasi untuk menjaga stabilisasi.
PERAWATAN POST OPERATIVE
Perawatan Pin-track.
Pin site dibersihkan tiap hari dengan menggunakan cairan hydrogen peroxide atau sabun antibakteri atau dengan larutan betadine. Pasien dilatih tiap 2-4 minggu sampai penyembuhan fraktur. Pin site dijaga agar tidak terjadi infeksi dan semua hubungan fiksator di cek untuk memastikan tetap saling berhubungan. Pada 4-6 minggu pertama hanya diberikan latihan keseimbangan berat badan. Pada pasien dengan trauma pada tumit yang tidak stabil, maka pin pada kaki dapat di pertahankan lebih lama sampai tumit dapat stabil kembali.
Timing of procedure
Intramedullary nailing atau pemasangan plat atau fiksasi interna dipertimbangkan aman jika dilaksanakan dalam dua minggu pertama setelah fiksasi eksterna, dimana perawatan pin-site baik tanpa tanda-tanda infeksi. Kemudian fiksasi eksterna dapat dilepaskan setelah 6-8 minggu dengan mempertimbangkan fracture healing.
KOMPLIKASI
Terdapat beberapa potensi komplikasi dengan sepsis yang pada umumnya terjadi yaitu :
Pin Tract Infection. Tanpa adanya keahlian dalam teknik pemasangan pin dan perawatan yang baik, maka hal ini merupakan komplikasi yang pada umumnya paling banyak terjadi sekitar 30 %. Dimulai dari proses radang yang berasal dari luka sampai terjadi infeksi superfisial yang dapat menyebabkan terjadinya osteomyelitis hingga memerlukan pemberian antibiotik.
Gangguan Neurovaskular . Seorang ahli bedah harus mengetahui daerah “safe zone” dan “danger zone” sebelum memasang pin.

DEFINISI
Fiksasi eksterna adalah alat yang diletakkan diluar kulit untuk menstabilisasikan fragmen tulang dengan memasukkan dua atau tiga pin metal perkutaneus menembus tulang pada bagian proksimal dan distal dari tempat fraktur dan pin tersebut dihubungkan satu sama lain dengan menggunakan eksternal bars. Teknik ini terutama atau kebanyakan digunakan untuk fraktur pada tulang tibia, tetapi juga dapat dilakukan pada tulang femur, humerus dan pelvis.

Pada pelvis, kompresi oleh fiksasi eksterna dapat menstabilisasikan pelvis, mengurangi perdarahan, sebagai penatalaksanaan resusitasi awal dan sebagai definitive treatment pada beberapa trauma .
Fiksasi eksterna terutama digunakan ketika terdapat luka dan trauma pada jaringan lunak yang merupakan kontraindikasi langsung untuk dilakukan pembedahan terhadap fraktur.
TIPE FIKSASI EKSTERNA
Terdapat beberapa tipe fiksasi eksterna yaitu :
Pin fixators : unilateral, bilateral frame, V-shaped dan triangular.<br>&nbsp;Ring (Wire fixator)
Hybrid fixators (wire and pin), adalah tipe fiksasi eksternal yang digunakan untuk fraktur tertutup pada sendi. Dinamakan hybrid karena terdiri dari wire fixation (3/4 ring fixator) dengan pin fixator (fiksasi unilateral pada bagian diafisis).
Pinless external fixators , tujuan utama desain dari pinless fixator adalah untuk menghindari tembusnya pin kedalam kanalis medularis.
Mefisto, merupakan teknik fiksasi eksterna yang baru diperkenalkan dan dirancang untuk limb lengthening dan bone transport.
INDIKASI
Terdapat indikasi absolut untuk penatalaksanan fiksasi baik internal maupun eksternal pada fraktur yang terbagi menjadi dua bagian utama yaitu :
<br><ol><li>Saving life, yang dimaksud dengan saving life atau menyelamatkan hidup adalah dengan adanya stabilisasi yang cepat maka dapat mengurangi resiko terjadinya kematian</li><li>Saving Limb, stabilisasi pada fraktur diafisis merupakan suatu bagian penatalaksanan darurat terutama pada fraktur dengan trauma jaringan lunak dimana dengan stabilisasi dapat mengurangi kerusakan yang lebih lanjut pada jaringan lunak.

METODE DAN TEKNIK PEMASANGAN
METODE
Terdapat dua metode yang pada umumnya digunakan untuk meletakkan pin yang digunakan pada fiksasi eksterna yaitu :

Through-and-through, yaitu masing-masing pin dimasukkan melalui kulit dan menembus fragmen tulang kemudian keluar menembus kulit pada sisi sebelahnya.
One-side (Cantilever system), yaitu pin dimasukkan melewati fragmen tulang tetapi tidak sampai menembus sampai pada sisi sebelah dan menonjol hanya pada salah satu sisi tubuh.
 TEKNIK PEMASANGAN

Teknik pin insertion
Sebelum dilakukan fiksasi, berikan tanda silang pada tempat atau daerah “safe Zone” sebagai tempat untuk memasukkan pin dan meminimalkan resiko trauma pada sistem saraf, pembuluh darah dan tendo.&nbsp;</li></ol>Sumber :&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://ilmubedah.info/fiksasi-eksterna-external-fixation-20110206.html">http://ilmubedah.info/fiksasi-eksterna-external-fixation-20110206.html</a><br>', "updated_at" = '2013-02-13 16:30:31.138005' WHERE "blogs"."id" = 1

DEFINISI
Fiksasi eksterna adalah alat yang diletakkan diluar kulit untuk menstabilisasikan fragmen tulang dengan memasukkan dua atau tiga pin metal perkutaneus menembus tulang pada bagian proksimal dan distal dari tempat fraktur dan pin tersebut dihubungkan satu sama lain dengan menggunakan eksternal bars. Teknik ini terutama atau kebanyakan digunakan untuk fraktur pada tulang tibia, tetapi juga dapat dilakukan pada tulang femur, humerus dan pelvis.

Pada pelvis, kompresi oleh fiksasi eksterna dapat menstabilisasikan pelvis, mengurangi perdarahan, sebagai penatalaksanaan resusitasi awal dan sebagai definitive treatment pada beberapa trauma .
Fiksasi eksterna terutama digunakan ketika terdapat luka dan trauma pada jaringan lunak yang merupakan kontraindikasi langsung untuk dilakukan pembedahan terhadap fraktur.
TIPE FIKSASI EKSTERNA
Terdapat beberapa tipe fiksasi eksterna yaitu :
Pin fixators : unilateral, bilateral frame, V-shaped dan triangular.<br>&nbsp;Ring (Wire fixator)
Hybrid fixators (wire and pin), adalah tipe fiksasi eksternal yang digunakan untuk fraktur tertutup pada sendi. Dinamakan hybrid karena terdiri dari wire fixation (3/4 ring fixator) dengan pin fixator (fiksasi unilateral pada bagian diafisis).
Pinless external fixators , tujuan utama desain dari pinless fixator adalah untuk menghindari tembusnya pin kedalam kanalis medularis.
Mefisto, merupakan teknik fiksasi eksterna yang baru diperkenalkan dan dirancang untuk limb lengthening dan bone transport.
INDIKASI
Terdapat indikasi absolut untuk penatalaksanan fiksasi baik internal maupun eksternal pada fraktur yang terbagi menjadi dua bagian utama yaitu :
<br><ol><li>Saving life, yang dimaksud dengan saving life atau menyelamatkan hidup adalah dengan adanya stabilisasi yang cepat maka dapat mengurangi resiko terjadinya kematian</li><li>Saving Limb, stabilisasi pada fraktur diafisis merupakan suatu bagian penatalaksanan darurat terutama pada fraktur dengan trauma jaringan lunak dimana dengan stabilisasi dapat mengurangi kerusakan yang lebih lanjut pada jaringan lunak.

METODE DAN TEKNIK PEMASANGAN
METODE
Terdapat dua metode yang pada umumnya digunakan untuk meletakkan pin yang digunakan pada fiksasi eksterna yaitu :

Through-and-through, yaitu masing-masing pin dimasukkan melalui kulit dan menembus fragmen tulang kemudian keluar menembus kulit pada sisi sebelahnya.
One-side (Cantilever system), yaitu pin dimasukkan melewati fragmen tulang tetapi tidak sampai menembus sampai pada sisi sebelah dan menonjol hanya pada salah satu sisi tubuh.
 TEKNIK PEMASANGAN

Teknik pin insertion
Sebelum dilakukan fiksasi, berikan tanda silang pada tempat atau daerah “safe Zone” sebagai tempat untuk memasukkan pin dan meminimalkan resiko trauma pada sistem saraf, pembuluh darah dan tendo.&nbsp;</li></ol>Sumber :&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://ilmubedah.info/fiksasi-eksterna-external-fixation-20110206.html">http://ilmubedah.info/fiksasi-eksterna-external-fixation-20110206.html</a><br>', "updated_at" = '2013-02-13 16:31:56.375865' WHERE "blogs"."id" = 1[0m

DEFINISI
Fiksasi eksterna adalah alat yang diletakkan diluar kulit untuk menstabilisasikan fragmen tulang dengan memasukkan dua atau tiga pin metal perkutaneus menembus tulang pada bagian proksimal dan distal dari tempat fraktur dan pin tersebut dihubungkan satu sama lain dengan menggunakan eksternal bars. Teknik ini terutama atau kebanyakan digunakan untuk fraktur pada tulang tibia, tetapi juga dapat dilakukan pada tulang femur, humerus dan pelvis.
<br><br>Prinsip dasar dari teknik ini adalah dengan menggunakan pin yang diletakkan pada bagian proksimal dan distal terhadap daerah atau zona trauma, kemudian pin-pin tersebut dihubungkan satu sama lain dengan rangka luar atau eksternal frame atau rigid bars yang berfungsi untuk menstabilisasikan fraktur.

Pada pelvis, kompresi oleh fiksasi eksterna dapat menstabilisasikan pelvis, mengurangi perdarahan, sebagai penatalaksanaan resusitasi awal dan sebagai definitive treatment pada beberapa trauma .
Fiksasi eksterna terutama digunakan ketika terdapat luka dan trauma pada jaringan lunak yang merupakan kontraindikasi langsung untuk dilakukan pembedahan terhadap fraktur.
TIPE FIKSASI EKSTERNA
Terdapat beberapa tipe fiksasi eksterna yaitu :
Pin fixators : unilateral, bilateral frame, V-shaped dan triangular.<br>&nbsp;Ring (Wire fixator)
Hybrid fixators (wire and pin), adalah tipe fiksasi eksternal yang digunakan untuk fraktur tertutup pada sendi. Dinamakan hybrid karena terdiri dari wire fixation (3/4 ring fixator) dengan pin fixator (fiksasi unilateral pada bagian diafisis).
Pinless external fixators , tujuan utama desain dari pinless fixator adalah untuk menghindari tembusnya pin kedalam kanalis medularis.
Mefisto, merupakan teknik fiksasi eksterna yang baru diperkenalkan dan dirancang untuk limb lengthening dan bone transport.
INDIKASI
Terdapat indikasi absolut untuk penatalaksanan fiksasi baik internal maupun eksternal pada fraktur yang terbagi menjadi dua bagian utama yaitu :
<br><ol><li>Saving life, yang dimaksud dengan saving life atau menyelamatkan hidup adalah dengan adanya stabilisasi yang cepat maka dapat mengurangi resiko terjadinya kematian</li><li>Saving Limb, stabilisasi pada fraktur diafisis merupakan suatu bagian penatalaksanan darurat terutama pada fraktur dengan trauma jaringan lunak dimana dengan stabilisasi dapat mengurangi kerusakan yang lebih lanjut pada jaringan lunak.

METODE DAN TEKNIK PEMASANGAN
METODE
Terdapat dua metode yang pada umumnya digunakan untuk meletakkan pin yang digunakan pada fiksasi eksterna yaitu :

Through-and-through, yaitu masing-masing pin dimasukkan melalui kulit dan menembus fragmen tulang kemudian keluar menembus kulit pada sisi sebelahnya.
One-side (Cantilever system), yaitu pin dimasukkan melewati fragmen tulang tetapi tidak sampai menembus sampai pada sisi sebelah dan menonjol hanya pada salah satu sisi tubuh.
 TEKNIK PEMASANGAN

Teknik pin insertion
Sebelum dilakukan fiksasi, berikan tanda silang pada tempat atau daerah “safe Zone” sebagai tempat untuk memasukkan pin dan meminimalkan resiko trauma pada sistem saraf, pembuluh darah dan tendo.&nbsp;</li></ol>Sumber :&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://ilmubedah.info/fiksasi-eksterna-external-fixation-20110206.html">http://ilmubedah.info/fiksasi-eksterna-external-fixation-20110206.html</a><br>', "updated_at" = '2013-02-13 16:33:22.192645' WHERE "blogs"."id" = 1[0m
